# Python-codes
This repository deals with python codes that helps in learning about Python


Let us talk about the details in teh programs that have been created

1) Diceroll:
 
 This program basically deals with teh logic of rolling a die in order to get a favourable result
 Let us look at the logic of the code
 
 First and foremost, we imported a random function in order to generate the random nature of the die
 Then, we took two integers called as minval and maxval. 
 In the minval, we gave an if condition stating if the number entered is less than or greater than 1, then the condition fails,
 else, the condition passes if it is equivalent to 1
 
 In the maxval, we gave an if condition stating if the number entered is greater than 6, then the condition is invalid.
 
 Now, we activated a variable called as again by changing its value to True.
 By doing this, we starightaway brought it into the picture and took the help of the While loop in
 order to create a condition.
 In the whileloop, we took the help of the random function and then we generated a random value between the minval
 and the maxval variable.
 
 To add some fun element, we created a function called as more_roll taking an input from the user
 if we wished to roll the dice more.
 Then we added an if condition that stated if the answer is Yes or Y, then the loop continues, else
 the loop stops.
 
 In this manner we created a program that simulates the functioning of a rolling die.

 2) Rock Paper Scissor:
 This is a classic problem that helps in knowing the randomness we can see in python.
 Let us go ahead with the code.
 We imported a function called as randomint from the random library.
 After that we then declared a variable called as m, wherein, we declared the values for Rock Paper and scissor.
 Then, we declared a value for computer wherein we used randomint function to randomly select any value between rock, paper and scissor.
 Here, we declare a value by the name player amongst us as False. The reason being as for the time being, we wish to activate the value of computer first.
 After we choose between rock, paper and scissor, only when we as a player get activated.
 We then declare a while loop wherein we take under condition of player as false.
 After that we compared the conditions between player and computer so as to get the exact result.
 
 
 
 These programs basically help in exploring the random library of python and thus, help in understanding the use of the same.
